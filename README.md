### Project Description
[The Smart Complaint Review System allows users to register complaints, track their progress, and provide feedback on resolutions. It streamlines communication between users and administrators, ensuring timely issue resolution. The system includes admin management, status updates, and feedback collection for continuous improvement.]

### The Problem statement
[The problem addressed by the Smart Complaint Review System is the inefficiency in handling and resolving user complaints in organizations. Traditional methods often lack transparency, timely updates, and proper feedback mechanisms, leading to user dissatisfaction and unresolved issues. This system aims to streamline complaint management, enhance communication between users and administrators, and provide a structured way to track and resolve complaints efficiently.]

### The Solution
[1.Automated Complaint Registration: Users can easily submit complaints through an online platform, ensuring all issues are recorded.
2.Real-Time Status Tracking: Users can monitor the progress of their complaints, receiving updates at every stage (e.g., pending, in progress, resolved).
3.Efficient Admin Management: Administrators can manage, assign, and prioritize complaints, leading to faster resolution.]

### Implementation
For Software:
1. System Setup:
Install XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP to set up a local development environment with PHP, MySQL, and Apache.
Clone the project repository and set up the file structure on the local server.
2. Database Configuration:
Create a MySQL database for the system.
Use phpMyAdmin to import the provided SQL script (if available) or manually create tables for users, complaints, feedback, and admin.
3. User and Admin Interface:
Design the frontend using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) for complaint submission, feedback forms, and status tracking pages.
Build the admin panel for managing and resolving complaints.

Test the system using different user roles (user/admin) and edge cases (e.g., invalid input, multiple complaints).
Use Postman or other tools to test any backend API functionality.
7. Deployment:
Deploy the system on a web server, such as Apache, or host it using a cloud platform.
Configure the domain and database connection for live use.
8. Maintenance:
Set up regular maintenance for managing database backups, security updates, and system optimization.
